                <li>Astro Bot credits contain mentions of seven unrealized crossovers that could still make their way to the game.</li>
                <li>They suggest that characters from Stellar Blade, Worms, and Assassin's Creed, among other franchises, might reach Astro Bot in the future.</li>
                <li>Team Asobi previously confirmed that Astro Bot will receive some free post-launch DLC soon after hitting the market.</li>

            <p>Astro Bot's credits hint at more than half a dozen additional cameos that may be coming to the game in the future. Assuming these potential arrivals are indeed on the cards, there's a good chance that they'll be added to Astro Bot for free.</p>
            <p>The latest title from Sony's Tokyo-based subsidiary Team Asobi was released for the PlayStation 5 on September 6. It generated a lot of extremely positive buzz ahead of its market debut, as underlined by the fact that Astro Bot is currently the highest-rated game of 2024. Aside from its immense gameplay variety, Astro Bot was widely praised for its impressive collection of over 170 cameos from both PlayStation and third-party video game franchises.</p>

        <p>Aside from these newly leaked character addition hints, it's a bit surprising that Astro Bot doesn't have any Final Fantasy or Marvel's Spider-Man cameos.</p>
