            <p>Team Asobi threw an Astro Bot launch party in Astro's Playroom. Astro Bot has been in the works for a few years, and cautious excitement has led to outright optimism on the part of many gamers. Many people have been wanting to see a full-fledged Astro Bot game for the PlayStation 5 since its launch, since Astro is a character that has been used to show off what makes the PlayStation brand so special in smaller titles like Astro's Playroom.</p>
            <p>People are loving Astro Bot so far. This game is being lauded as PlayStation's own Super Mario 64 moment, albeit nearly 30 years later. For uninitiated gamers, Astro Bot is a brand-new character platformer title that makes use of the PlayStation brand and DualSense controller, using Sony deep cuts to appeal to nostalgia while seeking interesting ways to expand on traditional approaches to gameplay. Astro Bot launched on September 6.</p>
