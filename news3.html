            <p>A recent leak from Honkai: Star Rail is teasing the potential addition of a brand-new Path to the game, suggesting there may be a new class for the RPG's characters soon. Fans of the massively popular RPG from HoYoverse have plenty of options to consider when building team compositions, ranging from a character's individual stats to their synergy with other characters. Star Rail currently features seven different elemental "Types" among its playable cast, alongside seven unique Paths serving as classes. Now, leaks are potentially hinting at the addition of the game's eighth character Path.</p>
            <p>Paths serve an important purpose in defining each character's playstyle within Honkai: Star Rail's roster, typically associated with a character's kit. Star Rail's Paths can offer a wide range of ability schemes for players, with Paths like The Hunt and Destruction often lending themselves to offensive characters while Abundance and Harmony fill support roles. HoYoverse has also teased several more in-game Paths through the lore and the Simulated Universe, including Remembrance, Elation, and Voracity among others. A new leak is suggesting one Honkai: Star Rail Path will finally become playable soon.</p>
