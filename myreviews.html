        <div class="review">
            <h3>Call Of Duty</h3>
            <p>Overall the game is good if you don't play it</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
            <p> Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best game, such realistic games simply do not exist, I am surprised how much the developers of the game bothered with the little things, in terms of the plot 10 out of 10, purely to pass the plot took more than 80 hours, the graphics on ultra are just a bomb 10 out of 10, in my opinion this is the best graphics, I want to highlight the pretty good optimization. The result for your money the game is just a bomb 10 out of 10, I recommend to everyone to buy who wants to visit America, 1899.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>Lethal Company</h3>
            <p>The game is great, but the graphics settings are really needed. The game seems to be very easy, but it lags constantly. It would be cool if it was possible to turn off all sorts of reflections, effects, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>Dota 2</h3>
            <p>at the beginning of the game I thought that there were 9 stupid players in this game but in the end it turned out that there were 10 stupid players
                there are such friendly players in the game that they all love your family</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>Rust</h3>
            <p>RUST is when you log in for 20 minutes and log out 11 hours later the next morning.
                RUST is when you see a homeless person rummaging through a trash can on the street of your city and you think "damn, they've already looted it".
                RUST is when you hear someone say "I'm friendly" and run as far away from them as you can.
                RUST is when a top weapon accidentally falls into your hands and you keep it in a box until the wipe, and you run around with a bow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>The Sims 4</h3>
            <p>At least in this game you can have money, a plot of land, a house, a job, friends and a girlfriend.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="review">
            <h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
            <p>An incredible story about broken people. So true to life that your heart begins to ache from recognition. Broken destinies, the illusion of luxury and freedom. A city that will chew you up and spit you out.
                This story definitely leaves a response in your soul.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="review">
            <h3>Grand Theft Auto V</h3>
            <p>Thumbs down in solidarity with the comrades banned by the mad anti-cheat. I myself have banned two comrades. One has 2500 hours played, the other 3500 hours, most of which was spent on endless and terribly boring money farming, all for the sake of one day receiving a standard reply from the bot: "Blocking decisions are final and cannot be appealed." Without explaining specific reasons, of course.
        
                An online game with such a policy towards customers should not have positive ratings. It simply should not.</p>
